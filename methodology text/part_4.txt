Where φ is the view factor, ε is the emissivity of the flames and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant (5.67 x 10-11 kW/m2/K4).

To incorporate a margin of safety, the train was treated as a black box emitter with an emissivity of 1.

Annex C of PD 7974-1 gives the expressions for calculating the view factor. The view factor for a radiating panel with the
receiver facing the panel and in the corner of the panel can be calculated from:
