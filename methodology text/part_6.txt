Where W is the width of the panel, H is the height of the panel and s is the distance to the receiver. To calculate the view factor for more complex radiating panels, such as those representing a train, the panel can also be broken down into smaller, simpler panels, the view factor calculated for the smaller panels and the view factors added/subtracted to find the total view factor, just as with radiating panels with the receiver at the corner.
